### 📜 Evolution of Democracy
Democracy, where the adult population has a say in governance, has evolved significantly in the UK. At the start of the 19th century, only a small fraction of the population—property-owning men over 21—could vote. Over the century, voting rights expanded, and political parties began involving citizens as members.

### ✊ The Chartists Movement
The Chartists campaigned in the 1830s and 1840s for reforms like:
- Universal male suffrage 🗳️
- Annual parliamentary elections 🗓️
- Equal electoral districts ⚖️
- Secret ballots 🕵️
- No property qualifications for MPs 🏛️
- Salaries for MPs 💷

By 1928, men and women over 21 could vote. The voting age was lowered to 18 in 1969.
